            Hello, my name is Luis Zegarra. I am from Tacna, Peru. I spent many years in comercial roles—sales, post-sales, and marketing—and most recently served as a Commercial Supervisor. However, a motorcycle accident left me with a triple fracture in my left leg. Doctors said I would need crutches for at least a year, but through the Lord’s tender mercies and much determination, I was able to walk freely again in under three months.  This challenge became a powerful turning point in my life. After completing a technical course, I began working as a freelance Technical Support professional and now feel inspired to become a Software Developer. My hope is to find a remote position that allows me to care for my father and spend more time with my two wonderful daughters, aged six and thirteen.  I share this journey with gratitude in my heart for the gospel and the blessings that come from trusting in our Heavenly Father. I look forward to learning and growing alongside all of you. Thank you for allowing me to be part of this group.
